Font size changes are generally with `CTRL +` or `CTRL -`

Package (Application) Management from GUI: 
Open the Konsole menu has "update" and "add and remove software" in the favorites (opening) tab.
Worst case, just search either of those names.
If you don't find what you want, look at the terminal version at the bottom.
Most should be in the "add or remove software" thing, though.

YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW:

- You have nextcloud-client installed. Sync folder is called "Nextcloud"
- If you want to download a video from a webpage without visiting the site or to just keep a copy, open a terminal `youtube-dl "link-to-video"` and you will have a copy.
- You have two terminals. Kitty is nicer, but if it ever doesn't work, try searching for xterm
- If you want to change your background, right click the desktop and select "configure desktop".
- If you want to change your lock screen, open the KDE menu (Equivalent of Windows Menu) and open "screen locking"
