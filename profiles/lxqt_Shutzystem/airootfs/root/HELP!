Font size changes are generally with `CTRL +` or `CTRL -`

YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW:
On boot, you have various options
- Persistence storage is the system that will include the changes you make over time
- live boot will load the OS and work off your USB, but will have everything the same as the day it was made
- emergency/rescue... is meant for people like Elio and I when something breaks.
- CopyToRam is my favorite: Copy the live boot system into memory! You need enough RAM to do this, but is abolutely the fastest. You can even unplug your USB once it has loaded, and everything will work the same.

In the system
- You have nextcloud-client installed. Sync folder is called "Nextcloud"
- If you want to download a video from a webpage without visiting the site or to just keep a copy, open a terminal `youtube-dl "link-to-video"` and you will have a copy.
- You have two terminals. Kitty is nicer, but if it ever doesn't work, try searching for xterm

You normally are using the "desktop environment" (AKA: DE) called "LXQT".
My favorite is KDE; it is just too big for computers with 4GB of RAM when doing a CopyToRam. 
You can choose your desktop environment on the login screen. 
"I didn't login!" Respons: "Okay... 'Logout' and you will see that screen."

If you are use KDE, such as in the persistent storage:
- If you want to change your background, right click the desktop and select "configure desktop".
- If you want to change your lock screen, open the KDE menu (Equivalent of Windows Menu) and open "screen locking"
- If you want to change your computer's color scheme, open the KDE menu and open "Global theme" or "Plasma Style".

Package (Application) Management from GUI (this may or may not be installed on the base version): 
Open the Konsole menu has "update" and "add and remove software" in the favorites (opening) tab.
Worst case, just search either of those names.
If you don't find what you want, look at the terminal version at the bottom.
Most should be in the "add or remove software" thing, though.

Remove something: 		pacman -Rs PACKAGE
Remv smthin and cfg files	pacman -Rns PACKAGE
Update computer:		pacman -Syu

-S   = Sync
-Ss  = search
-Sy  = look for new versions
-Su  = upgrade packages
-Syu = check for updates and upgrade
-R   = remove
-Rs  = Reverse sync
-Rns = Reverse sync, including backed up files for this app (like the configuration files)

You will most likely prefer to use -Rns most.
