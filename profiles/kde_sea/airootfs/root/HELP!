Package (Application) Management from GUI: 
Open the Konsole menu has "update" and "add and remove software" in the favorites (opening) tab.
Worst case, just search either of those names.
If you don't find what you want, look at the terminal version at the bottom.
Most should be in the "add or remove software" thing, though.

YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW:

- You have nextcloud-client installed. Sync folder is called "Nextcloud"
- If you want to download a video from a webpage without visiting the site or to just keep a copy, open a terminal `youtube-dl "link-to-video"` and you will have a copy.
- You have two terminals "kitty" and "konsole". Kitty is nicer, but if it ever doesn't work, try Konsole
- If you want to change your background, right click the desktop and select "configure desktop".
- If you want to change your lock screen, open the KDE menu (Equivalent of Windows Menu) and open "screen locking"
- If you want to change your computer's color scheme, open the KDE menu and open "Global theme" or "Plasma Style".

Remv smthin and cfg files	yay -Rns PACKAGE

-S   = Sync
-Ss  = search
-Sy  = look for new versions
-Su  = upgrade packages
-Syu = check for updates and upgrade
-R   = remove
-Rs  = Reverse sync
-Rns = Reverse sync, including backed up files for this app (like the configuration files)

You will most likely prefer to use -Rns most.
